HOWTO Create the published background, using "Gimp"
	(File: published.xcf)

1. Write text:
	Font: Sans Bold
	Size: 75px
	Color: #000000 (Black)

2. Rotate text:
	Select the text layer(s)
	Layer > Transform > Arbitrary Rotation...
		Angle: -15

3. Create the text outline
	Create a new layer (refered as "Outline"
	Right-click the text layer > Alpha to Selection
	Select the new empty Outline layer
	Select > Grow...
		2 pixels
	Edit > Fill with FG Color (assuming your foreground color is the default black)
	Right-click the text layer > Alpha to Selection
	Select the Outline layer
	Select > Shrink...
		2 pixels
	Backspace (to clear the content of the selection within the Outline layer, creating the outline effect)

4. Position the text so it do not overlap with others
	Those background may be used toggether.

5. Save the layers as PNG
	Make only one "Outline" layer visible (no background, we want the PNG to be transparent)
	Opacity: 10%
	File > Save as
		PNG image (*.png)
